Its roots lie in early efforts to organize and retrieve information manually, which laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated search technologies", "Pre-Computer Era The earliest forms of IR can be traced back to ancient civilizations like Egypt and Greece, where libraries served as hubs of knowledge. Early systems for organizing information included manual indexing methods, which revolutionized the way books were cataloged and accessed.

The Boolean retrieval model, based on logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT, became a cornerstone of early systems. Researchers also introduced techniques like relevance feedback, allowing users to refine search results iteratively", "Growth and Commercialization The 1970s and 1980s marked a period of rapid growth in IR. Commercial systems such as DIALOG and LexisNexis provided access to large databases of documents, enabling professionals to conduct real-time interactive searches", "Evaluation metrics like precision and recall were introduced to measure system effectiveness, and user interfaces began evolving to simplify query construction", "Modern Era With the advent of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, IR faced new challenges and opportunities. Search engines like AltaVista, Yahoo, and later Google redefined how information was retrieved, using advanced algorithms like PageRank to rank web pages by relevance. The scope of IR also expanded to include multimedia retrieval, incorporating images, audio, and video alongside text. Natural Language Processing \ue081NLP\ue082 became integral, improving systems' understanding of user intent", "Information Retrieval in a Broader and Narrow Sense Broader Sense of IR In its broader sense, IR encompasses the entire discipline of finding and organizing information that meets people's needs. This perspective includes not just the technical aspects of search systems but also the underlying motivation for human knowledge discovery. It covers a wide range of tasks such as classification, clustering, recommendation systems, social network analysis, question answering, and human-computer interaction. For instance, fields like Introduction to Information Retrieval 5psychology and cognitive science play roles in understanding how users interact with IR systems", "Broadly defined, IR is a response to information overload, where the goal is to identify relevant knowledge from vast data repositories. Applications go beyond traditional document retrieval, addressing challenges in areas like digital libraries, bioinformatics, and social media analysis", "Narrow Sense of IR In a narrower sense, IR is more focused on \"search\"\u2014specifically, designing algorithms and systems to locate information within large collections of materials", "This includes text documents, multimedia content, or structured data, but the emphasis is on the computational and algorithmic aspects of retrieval. Here, the user initiates the process by expressing an information need through a query, and the system responds with ranked results based on relevance", "For example, a web search engine retrieves web pages in response to a keyword query.
