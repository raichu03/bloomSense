Meanwhile, other botanists such as 1796 and Tate 1831 began to question the distinction between Azalea and Rhododendron, and finally in 1836, Azalea was incorporated into Rhododendron and the genus divided into eight sections.

This structure largely survived till recently 2004, following which the development of molecular phylogeny led to major reexaminations of traditional morphological classifications, although other authors such as Candolle, who described six sections, used slightly different numeration.", "Soon, as more species became available in the nineteenth century so did a better understanding of the characteristics necessary for the major divisions. Chief amongst these were s Rhododendreae Asiae Orientali and . Maximovicz used flower bud position and its relationship with leaf buds to create eight Sections. used a similar scheme, but called the divisions Series. It was not until 1893 that appreciated the significance of scaling and hence the separation of lepidote and elepidote species. The large number of species that were available by the early twentieth century prompted a new approach when introduced the concept of grouping species into . The Species of Rhododendron referred to this series concept as the Balfourian system. That system continued up to modern times in Davidians four volume The Rhododendron Species.", "The next major attempt at classification was by who from 1934 began incorporating the Balfourian series into the older hierarchical structure of subgenera and sections, according to the , culminating in 1949 with his Ein System der Gattung Rhododendron and subsequent refinements. Most of the Balfourian series are represented by Sleumer as subsections, though some appear as sections or even subgenera. Sleumer based his system on the relationship of the flower buds to the leaf buds, habitat, flower structure, and whether the leaves were lepidote or nonlepidote. While Sleumers work was widely accepted, many in the United States and the United Kingdom continued to use the simpler Balfourian system of the Edinburgh group.", "Sleumers system underwent many revisions by others, predominantly the Edinburgh group in their continuing notes. Cullen of the Edinburgh group, placing more emphasis on the lepidote characteristics of the leaves, united all of the lepidote species into subgenus Rhododendron, including four of Sleumers subgenera Rhododendron, Pseudoazalea, Pseudorhodorastrum, Rhodorastrum. In 1986 Philipson  raised two sections of subgenus Aleastrum Mumeazalea, Candidastrum to subgenera, while reducing genus Therorhodion to a subgenus of Rhododendron.

Then Judd  Kron moved two species  and  from section Brachybachii, subgenus Tsutsusi and two from section Rhodora, subgenus Pentanthera ,  into section Sciadorhodion, subgenus Pentanthera.

Following publication of the studies of Goetsch et al. 2005 with , there began an ongoing realignment of species and groups within the genus, based on evolutionary relationships. Their work was more supportive of Sleumers original system than the later modifications introduced by Chamberlain et al..", "The major finding of Goetsch and colleagues was that all species examined except , subgenus Therorhodion formed three major which they labelled A, B, and C, with the subgenera Rhododendron and Hymenanthes as monophyletic groups nested within clades A and B, respectively. By contrast subgenera Azaleastrum and Pentanthera were , while R. camtschaticum appeared as a to all other rhododendrons.

In addition to the two separate genera included under Rhododendron by Chamberlain , Tsusiophyllum, Goetsch et al.. added clade C. Despite a degree of , the subgenus Rhododendron was otherwise untouched with regard to its three sections but four other subgenera were eliminated and one new subgenus created, leaving a total of five subgenera in all, from eight in Chamberlains scheme. The discontinued subgenera are Pentanthera, Tsutsusi, Candidastrum and Mumeazalea, while a new subgenus was created by elevating subgenus Azaleastrum section Choniastrum to subgenus rank.", "Subgenus Pentanthera deciduous azaleas with its four sections was dismembered by eliminating two sections and redistributing the other two between the existing subgenera in clades B Hymenanthes and C Azaleastrum, although the name was retained in section Pentanthera 14 species which was moved to subgenus Hymenanthes. Of the remaining three sections, monotypic Viscidula was discontinued by moving to Tsutsusi C, while Rhodora 2 species was itself polyphyletic and was broken up by moving to section Pentanthera B and to section Sciadorhodion, which then became a new section of subgenus Azaleastrum C.", "Subgenus Tsutsusi C was reduced to section status retaining the name, and included in subgenus Azaleastrum. Of the three minor subgenera, all in C, two were discontinued. The single species of subgenus Candidastrum  was moved to subgenus Azaleastrum, section Sciadorhodion. Similarly the single species in monotypic subgenus Mumeazalea  was placed in the new section Tsutsusi, subgenus Azaleastrum. Genus Menziesa 9 species was also added to section Sciadorhodion. The remaining small subgenus Therorhodion with its two species was left intact. Thus two subgenera, Hymenanthes and Azaleastrum were expanded at the expense of four subgenera that were eliminated, although Azaleastrum lost one section Choniastrum as a new subgenus, since it was a distinct subclade in A. In all, Hymenanthes increased from one to two sections, while Azaleastrum, by losing one section and gaining two increased from two to three sections.
